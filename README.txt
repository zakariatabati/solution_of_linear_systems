## Introduction
	Linear systems are the building blocks of countless real-world phenomena, from engineering to economics. This project explores the 	elegant methods used to solve these systems
## Methods
	1. Algorithme_d'élimination_de_Gauss
		The Gauss method is considered the most popular among the direct methods. The principle of the method is to perform a series 		of arithmetic operations on the elements of the matrix in order to transform it into an upper triangular matrix, and then 		use the backtracking method to solve the obtained system. The principle of the Gauss elimination method is then to put the 		linear system Ax = b in the form Cxb = b where the matrix C is upper triangular.
